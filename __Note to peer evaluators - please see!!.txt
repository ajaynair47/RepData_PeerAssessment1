Hello

Apparently Rvstudio deletes the .md file by default. So you will only see the .rmd and .html file in my commit.

To evaluate my assignment, please review the .html file by prefixing http://htmlpreview.github.io/?

So the complete url will be 
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ajaynair47/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/e94f7c4e39b46c9713880faf83fce2f287348cce/PA1_template.html

The following blogs have some comments from the course TAs on this topic:
